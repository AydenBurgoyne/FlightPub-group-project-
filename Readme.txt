Notes about the Project:
This project is one of the first big group assignments I've worked on in University, it involved designing, documenting and implementing the project. 
At the moment the project is only half done as it's mean't to be completed over two semesters and this work is from the first. 

My role in the project:
During the project I found myself and another group member both being equal leaders in the project. I personally found myself designing how all the backend features worked. This includes the design but not implementation of the destination graph, database design and implementation 
and the design and implementation of the search function. I also found myself allocating backend work to various group members.

Technical Info:
Views-JSPS
Frameworks-Springframeworks
Backend language-Java
Database- MariaDB(MySQL)
IDE-Inteliji Ultimate

Tips for Running:
The easiest way to run this project is to open the project in Inteliji Ultimate then setup and run a mariaDB environment run the db scripts in order e.g 1,2,3 You'll have to input your database details into the META-INT/Context.xml file e.g host address, username and password etc. You may have to make sure the project is using the version of java that's installed on your computer. If you have any issues I'm happy to host the site if you contact me so you can look at it, it's just not practical for me to host it 24/7 however.

Description of the Project:
The project is to design and implement a new flight agency website. The goal with this is to implement new and interesting features for different potential users of the website.
For our project my group and I decided to cater to both business and recreational users. We decided to ask the user what type of user they were during account creation and
only presented the features that were relevant to that user group.
